# Simple Lane Detection
> An image processing pipeline to find lane lines on a road

## INTRODUCTION
In this project, I use Python3 and OpenCV to identify lane lines in images. I use techniques such as Canny edge detection and Hough transformation to develop a simple pipeline that can be used on still images or a video stream. A more detailed writeup is included in this project.

This project was undertaken as part of the [Udacity Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013).

## HOW TO USE

### Project dependencies
You can follow the guide explained here to help setup a working environment.
* https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit

You should be fine so long as you have installed Python3.5+ and OpenCV.

### Jupyter Notebooks
The included notebooks demonstrate how to use the project code.
